/**
 * This method level annotation can be used to make a Java method receive incoming web socket messages. Each websocket
 * endpoint may only have one message handling method for each of the native websocket message formats: text, binary and
 * pong. Methods using this annotation are allowed to have parameters of types described below, otherwise the container
 * will generate an error at deployment time.
 * <p>
 * The allowed parameters are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Exactly one of any of the following choices
 * <ul>
 * <li>if the method is handling text messages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link java.lang.String} to receive the whole message</li>
 * <li>Java primitive or class equivalent to receive the whole message converted to that type</li>
 * <li>String and boolean pair to receive the message in parts</li>
 * <li>{@link java.io.Reader} to receive the whole message as a blocking stream</li>
 * <li>any object parameter for which the endpoint has a text decoder ({@link Decoder.Text} or
 * {@link Decoder.TextStream}).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>if the method is handling binary messages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>byte[] or {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} to receive the whole message</li>
 * <li>byte[] and boolean pair, or {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} and boolean pair to receive the message in parts</li>
 * <li>{@link java.io.InputStream} to receive the whole message as a blocking stream</li>
 * <li>any object parameter for which the endpoint has a binary decoder ({@link Decoder.Binary} or
 * {@link Decoder.BinaryStream}).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>if the method is handling pong messages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link PongMessage} for handling pong messages</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>and Zero to n String or Java primitive parameters annotated with the {@code jakarta.websocket.server.PathParam}
 * annotation for server endpoints.</li>
 * <li>and an optional {@link Session} parameter</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The parameters may be listed in any order.
 *
 * <p>
 * The method may have a non-void return type, in which case the web socket runtime must interpret this as a web socket
 * message to return to the peer. The allowed data types for this return type, other than void, are String, ByteBuffer,
 * byte[], any Java primitive or class equivalent, and anything for which there is an encoder. If the method uses a Java
 * primitive as a return value, the implementation must construct the text message to send using the standard Java
 * string representation of the Java primitive unless there developer provided encoder for the type configured for this
 * endpoint, in which case that encoder must be used. If the method uses a class equivalent of a Java primitive as a
 * return value, the implementation must construct the text message from the Java primitive equivalent as described
 * above.
 *
 * <p>
 * Developers should note that if developer closes the session during the invocation of a method with a return type, the
 * method will complete but the return value will not be delivered to the remote endpoint. The send failure will be
 * passed back into the endpoint's error handling method.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64;OnMessage
 * public void processGreeting(String message, Session session) {
 *     System.out.println("Greeting received:" + message);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64;OnMessage
 * public void processUpload(byte[] b, boolean last, Session session) {
 *     // process partial data here, which check on last to see if these is more on the way
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Developers should not continue to reference message objects of type {@link java.io.Reader},
 * {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} or {@link java.io.InputStream} after the annotated method has completed, since they may
 * be recycled by the implementation.
